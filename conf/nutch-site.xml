  		<value>protocol-httpclient|urlfilter-regex|parse-(url|html|tika)|index-(basic|anchor)|scoring-opic|urlnormalizer-(pass|regex|basic)</value>
		<description>Regular expression naming plugin directory names to
		  include.  Any plugin not matching this expression is excluded.
		  In any case you need at least include the nutch-extensionpoints plugin. By
		  default Nutch includes crawling just HTML and plain text via HTTP,
		  and basic indexing and search plugins. In order to use HTTPS please enable 
		  protocol-httpclient, but be aware of possible intermittent problems with the 
		  underlying commons-httpclient library.

    <property>
  		<name>urlfilter.order</name>
  		<value>org.apache.nutch.urlfilter.regex.RegexURLFilter</value>
  		<description>The order by which url filters are applied.
  		If empty, all available url filters (as dictated by properties
		plugin-includes and plugin-excludes above) are loaded and applied in system
		defined order. If not empty, only named filters are loaded and applied
		in given order. For example, if this property has value:
		org.apache.nutch.urlfilter.regex.RegexURLFilter org.apache.nutch.urlfilter.prefix.PrefixURLFilter
		then RegexURLFilter is applied first, and PrefixURLFilter second.
		Since all filters are AND'ed, filter ordering does not have impact
		on end result, but it may have performance implication, depending
		on relative expensiveness of filters.
